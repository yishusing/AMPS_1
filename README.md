AMPS- Build 1

This is the first fully realised version of the AMPAR-centric Model of Postsynaptic Signalling (AMPS). This project, started in late 2016, is an attempt to create a maximalist model of a generic pyramidal dendritic spine in the hippocampus.

To achieve this, the initial build has been to merge together for distinct models into a single one. These four combined simulate almost all the different species of protein and ions involved in the biochemical reactome of the spine. The role of this model moving forward is to:

a) better understand AMPA receptor functionality and dynamics, 
b) utilise the model to investigate intellectual disability disorders such as Fragile X and SynGAP


As of this date (September 2017), the four integrated models are: 

Hayer and Bhalla (2005) - AMPAR dynamics and CaMKII switch
Iyengar and Bhalla (1999) - mGluR pathway
Jain (2009) - mTOR pathway and protein translation (generic)
Rao Padala et al (2017) - Wnt signalling pathway


More information is available in the COPASI/xml files themselves.
